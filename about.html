            	<h2>About Our Company</h2>
                <div class="box-5 right-1">
                    <p class="p2">Dragon Press began as a way for me to develop my early HTML skills, and to use some server class hardware I had in my home office (and the bandwidth I was sitting on).  The first few sites were bulletin board advertisements for family photo albums, small businesses, and pet projects.  The very first "real" client we added was Lasertech Inc, a toner and printer supplies company based out of Bedford, IN.  </p>
                    <p class="p2">After that early start, we spun up to a larger hosting environment, running full email, calendering and workplace software suites in addition to standard website hosting.  We offered mailing lists, directed client mails, and desktop support to some customers, notably DC International, the Sycamore Land Trust, AC/C Tech, and Hometown Heating & Air.  At peak we had about 45-50 clients, with a full breadth of services.</p>
                    <p class="p2">As services like Gmail and earlier variants of Office 365 began to appear, we decided that the hosting and desktop support services were getting to be a realm that was already heavily supported for a very small enterprise, and began staging back our supported offerings.  Shortly after this stage, the owner also went back to school, to pursue a Masters in Human Computer Interaction & Design, futher limiting available support time.</p>
                    <p class="p2">Now, Dragon Press seeks design challenges that can be self hosted, or helps direct clients to affordable hosting solutions, while providing design, developmental, and some site based technical support.  For an example of our current and recent work, please see the samples page.</p>  
                    <p class="p2">Thanks for stopping by! <br>-Adam</p>
